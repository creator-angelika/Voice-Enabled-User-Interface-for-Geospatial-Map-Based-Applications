# Voice-Enabled-User-Interface-for-Geospatial-Map-Based-Applications
This project develops a voice-enabled interface for a geospatial map-based application. Users can interact with the map via voice commands to zoom in/out and display highways. It features futuristic styled markers and seamless integration, enhancing user experience and accessibility in geospatial analysis.

Key features include:

Voice Commands: Users can easily control the map by issuing voice commands to zoom in, zoom out, or show highways in a specific state.
Styled Markers: Highways are represented with unique, transparent markers highlighted with black outlines, enhancing the map's aesthetic while maintaining functionality.
Interactive Experience: The integration of voice commands allows for hands-free interaction, making the map more accessible and engaging.
The application is particularly suited for geospatial analysis, aiming to improve accessibility and user engagement. By leveraging voice recognition technology, the project simplifies map navigation and data visualization, making it ideal for use in both professional and casual contexts.

This interface enhances user interaction with geospatial data by providing a seamless and intuitive way to explore and analyze map-based information.
